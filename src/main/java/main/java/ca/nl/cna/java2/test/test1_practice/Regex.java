                "Now, you might be thinking, \"Critic, why would you 123-5656 review something so private?\" Well, it's simple. In the age of oversharing and digital footprints, sometimes you have to look back at the past and laugh at the absurdity of it all. Plus, itâ€™s a hilarious reminder of how much information we give away without thinking twice. So, let's start with the basics.\n\n" +

Back when phone numbers were easy to remember and you didn't have to worry about telemarketers or spam calls. This number saw me through some of the most formative years of my life. Let's take a look at its highs and lows.\n\n" +
